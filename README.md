# Titanic-I.End-to-end Data Analytics Project

This project analyzes the survival rates of Titanic passengers based on factors such as passenger class, age, and other demographics. The analysis uses **SQL** for data extraction, **Python** for data processing and analysis, and **Tableau** for data visualization.

## Project Structure

- **data**: Contains the Titanic dataset in CSV format.
- **scripts**: Python scripts for data cleaning, analysis, and visualization.
- **sql**: SQL queries for extracting data.
- **tableau**: Tableau workbooks with visualizations.

## Tools
- **SQL**: Used to extract relevant data from the dataset.
- **Python**: For data preprocessing, analysis, and generating plots (using libraries like Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, and Seaborn).
- **Tableau**: For creating interactive visualizations.
